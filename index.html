            My favourite hobby is doing archery, but if we want to take hobby as a PART-TIME thing, then gaming. I love gaming on my console and PC. We get to learn a lot of things from games too like friendshipness and sportsmanship(teaming up etc. etc). Athough I absolutely love gaming in my freetime, I love playing outside with my friends(like cricket). Okay back to the gaming thing, I like gaming also because I am really good at it(I learn controls easily and am an absolute pro at the games I play).I make very good montages about it! I am in a professional ESPORTS team too(via FORTNITE) too! That was basically a brief section about my favourite hobby.</h2>
